# Security Policy

## Project Scope
This repository implements a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server in Deno/TypeScript, providing contextual information and tools for Terragrunt documentation and GitHub issues. It is intended for use by AI agents, IDE integrations, and developers working with Terragrunt.

## Supported Versions
- Only the `main` branch is officially supported. Please report vulnerabilities found in the latest code on this branch.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
If you discover a security vulnerability in this project, **please do not create a public GitHub issue**. Instead, follow these steps:

1. **Preferred:** [Open a private security advisory on GitHub](https://github.com/Excoriate/mcp-terragrunt-docs/security/advisories/new) (recommended for confidential reporting).
2. **Alternative:** Email the maintainer at [security@excoriate.io] with details of the vulnerability.

We will respond as quickly as possible and coordinate a fix and disclosure process.

## Responsible Disclosure
- Please provide as much detail as possible to help us understand and reproduce the issue.
- We ask that you give us a reasonable amount of time to address the vulnerability before any public disclosure.
- We are committed to transparent and responsible handling of all security reports.

## Exclusions
- This policy does not cover vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies (report those upstream).
- Do not use automated tools to perform denial-of-service or destructive testing.
